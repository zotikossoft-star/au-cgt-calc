"Brokerage","The fee or charge that is paid by you when transacting a buy or sell."
"Holder Identification Number (HIN)","When you are CHESS sponsored with a Broker you will be issued a unique number, called a HIN. Multiple holdings can be registered under the single HIN. A HIN starts with the letter X and usually followed by 10 numbers, e.g. X0001234567."
"Dividend","A dividend is a payment made to shareholders from the company. This payment is a portion of the company's profits. ASX listed companies typically pay dividends twice a year, usually as an 'interim' dividend and a 'final dividend'. From time to time, a company may also pay a 'special' dividend."
"Ex-dividend date","The ex-dividend date occurs two business days before the company's Record Date. To be entitled to a dividend a shareholder must have purchased the shares before the ex-dividend date.

"Payment date","The date on which a declared dividend is scheduled to be paid."
"Unfranked dividend","Dividends which do not carry a franking credit."
"Franked dividend","Franked dividends are paid to security holders out of profits on which the company has already paid tax."
