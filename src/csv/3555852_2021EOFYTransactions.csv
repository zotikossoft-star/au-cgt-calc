"GLOSSARY",""
"Units","The number of registered securities that you own."
"Unit Price","The Portfolio Valuation 'Unit Price' is calculated using a 'Reference' Price provided by the ASX which takes into account an adjustment to determine value at Close of Market if the Security does not trade in the Closing Single Price Auction on the Valuation Date."
"Brokerage","The fee or charge that is paid by you when transacting a buy or sell."
"Holder Identification Number (HIN)","When you are CHESS sponsored with a Broker you will be issued a unique number, called a HIN. Multiple holdings can be registered under the single HIN. A HIN starts with the letter X and usually followed by 10 numbers, e.g. X0001234567."
"Dividend","A dividend is a payment made to shareholders from the company. This payment is a portion of the company's profits. ASX listed companies typically pay dividends twice a year, usually as an 'interim' dividend and a 'final dividend'. From time to time, a company may also pay a 'special' dividend."
"Ex-dividend date","The ex-dividend date occurs two business days before the company's Record Date. To be entitled to a dividend a shareholder must have purchased the shares before the ex-dividend date.

"Special dividend","A dividend paid by the company outside typical recurring (interim and final) dividend cycle."
"Record date","The record date is the date the share registries use in determining who is entitled to a dividend or entitlement associated with a security. Those who held the security in the company and were on the register on the record date are eligible for the entitlement."
"Payment date","The date on which a declared dividend is scheduled to be paid."
"Unfranked dividend","Dividends which do not carry a franking credit."
"Franked dividend","Franked dividends are paid to security holders out of profits on which the company has already paid tax."
"Franking /Imputation Credit","A franking credit is your share of tax paid by a company on the profits from which your dividend is paid. They are also known as Imputation Credits."
"Total subscription","Total subscription can include, but is not limited to market data and research subscription fees and share trade alerts."
